not thus referred, there are two classes l'irst, those which are ccm-
tuon to several different editions and are uncredited in all, and 11101
therefore be considered common property; second, those which heve
been added by the American editor. Mostos the derived notes, besides
being translated, have been very much changed 111 their 101111, 11 being
sbridged, condensed, aud otherwise modified; sudio some cases so
much so, that it seemed hardly fair 10 impote the 0010111110 11011 shspe
to its real author. Some commento, therefore, will sppear 10 10 claim·
ed 101 this edition ss original, which, by suggestion at least, are due to
00011101. Βο1 11 will 10 very easy for any 0110, who has the 01111010
enumerated 111 the beginning of this 11101000, 10 see for himself 10 whst
extent dre notes 010 derived from others A slight comparison will
show that the 11000111 editor hoe hed little 10 do, hut to use hia judge
ment, in selecting 110111 the abundant materiale furuished by able schol·
010, and iu preparing what 110 should select for American studente.
No 11011 011110 writings of Cicero hes been 111010 fortunate than the
De Officiis io respect 101110 preservation end perfecting 01 110 text, nor
will it suffer in comperison with any in regord 10 110 ability with which
its text hes been illustrated end explained. Is the hoolr,now‚ 1101 with-
out diffidence, presented 10 the public, shall have contributed any thing
to 1110110 the valuuble labore of others more extensively availsble‚ 110
object will have been socomplished. It has been prepared iu the midst
01 other duties, and retarded in its preparation 11 the repeated and pro·
tracted illnoss of 110 editor, and might put in a ples 101 the indulgence
which 11 will doubtless need.

ln the first chapter 01 the second book, Cicero expresses the 0111110·
10001011, 1101 001110 good 111011 may find fault with his devotion to philos·
ophy. He vindicatos himself, however, by sayiug that he ceu no
longer benefit the commonwealth by his 0010 eud connsels, inesmnch
0011 is now under the tyrannical control 01 0110111011. He must,
therefore, give his sctivity 0 new direction Το yield 10 1101110110 grief,
in view os the ssd change in tho state, would soon exhaust and proe-
trate him. To give himself up to pleasures, 01 such 011 emergency,
would be unworthy 01 aman 01 his cultivation. He turus, therefore,
to philosophy 101 relies. lt had been a favorite study 01 his youth, end,
in the midst 01 active life, 10 had devoted to it what time he could gain
from professional and 1101111001 duties. Nor does he turnto philosophy
for relief merely. He 10 01111 influenced by 1101110110 1110111001 101 he
has in view the reputetion 01 Rome and the elevatiou of his country-
men.
