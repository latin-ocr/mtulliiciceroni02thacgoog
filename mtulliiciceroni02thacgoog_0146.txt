philosophy, in tanderstanding the somewhat obscure wotenees in this seorim

The Stoic believes that nothing can be a good forman which does not
pertaintohimself3 thatheis therefore onlyconcernedtoknowwhsthis

nature mand tlren to perfect it All men indeed uneonscieusly make it
their ultimate aim to bring themselves nearer to perfection But thewise

which the artificia} motives and social prejudiees and passione cf men seek
for happiness, aud shepes his course directly towards this goat

Nothing, at the first glance, appears more ahsmd in the system of the
Stoice than this: that they, who consider virtue the only good, set down all
the duties of which Cicero treats in this book among dsings indifferent-
thingswhich, like riehes and honor, are neithergood nor bad-which deserve
some preference to be sure, but never frnther thetnm happiness cf man.

But this system finds a parallel in the creed of theologiam, who consider
sinitrl the virtues cf the heathen, and account every performanee of duty,
which does not spring from Christian mouves, better indeed tlran the ueg-
lect of the same, but insufficient to maire man acceptuble to his Maker or
blessed in himself Now to the Christian ot these theologiam corresponds
the wisc man of the Stoics. The virtues cf the heathen and the unoonverted
are their media ‹afficio-sets by which extemal good is seenred and evil
avoided but which nevertheless give m sign of true, internal, moral good-
ness. Tne virtues of the Christian, the acts ot the completely reformed, cr
rather, the completely developed-the altogether perfect man-ere the
officia perfecta

'l'lre substance cf this is, that men’e acts hold a twofold relatim; one
to the beart and spirit cf the man, from which they spring, the other to
the effecto which they cetrae in the world Perfection-the true good, lies
only in man, in bis inuer, spiritual natiue, in bis fundes, his inclinatione

tiens mentioned above-they can share in perfectiori only so far as they
are the outbreaks of the soul's excellence

In the second relation, that is, in relation to the outward aime and con·
sequestres, each act can have only that degree ot valae or wortbleesness
which the things themselves have, of which it is the cause If I anenata
