But while Cicero thus defende his occupation to tho public, hohas a

private end perhaps e more weighty reason for the composition of this '

philosophicsl tertiae-s resson which should not be lost sight of in
reading it, for it gives e key to the character of the work The mo·
tire referred to is his desire to instruct his son.

He had sent him to Athens to pursue the study oi philosophy under
Cratippus} but moved by some unfevoreble reports respecting his con-
duct there, he hed determined to visit him. A sturm interrupted his
voyage soon ulier he had weighod sochor, aud drove him back to the
shore of Italy, and news from Rome prevented his setting suil »gain
He wrote thu treatise, therefore, es a substitute for the orel counsel
which he hed intended to gire. This fact-the fact that the work is
addressed by Cicero to his son-gives direction to the course of thought
contained in it. Itis not o code of morale for mankind in general, hut
it is particularly edspted to the circumstances of theson of a distin·
guished Roman statesmen, who might be expected to seek distinction
in public life cs his father hed done. The book, therefore, does not
eddress itself to the middle and lower classes, except es the general
principles embodied end discussed iu it are applic'able to their condi-
tion. The examples end illustratione are all drawn from the highest
offices in the state end from the highest welks of life. Thus the velue
of the treatise as o philosophicul work is perhaps diminished by the
connection oi its scope, while the interestis it is increused hythe fre-
quent display of parentsl regat-d.
