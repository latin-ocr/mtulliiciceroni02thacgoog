scanty. The example of the German editors already nomed and in·
deed of almost ull German commentatore, can, it is true, be quoted for
a different course. But it should be borne in mind that they prepare
their works for those who ere not supplied with these books of refer-
ence. A German commentsry is n transcript of the instructions of the
cluss-roem, where oral teaching takes the place of silent study, and, tc
egrest extent, supplies the want of manuale. Such a commentury
therefore contains all the explanatione which its author has been ac-
customed to give to his class3 not only granrmuticsl end critical com-
ments‚ but those ulso which perusin to geogmphy, history, biogruphy,
and antiquities. lt should be observed, however, that German pupils
do not, ss a general rule, make use of such commentarios, but of the
uuadorned text of the authors they study. Iu this edition a few notes
of the historicel class spoken of have been introduced, in cases where
the dictionaries in common use have not been found to conuin the de·
sired infomiation.

The general design of the brief commentaryis two-sold: first, to
sid the leamer in understanding the conteuts of the trestise, the
thoughts and connectione of thought of the suthon and second, to
explain grammatical difficulties, and especially to inculcstea know-
ledge of grammaticul principles 'I'he editor has airned throughout to q
guide rather than curry the learner through difficulties, requiring of
him more study in consequence of his help, then he would probably
have devoted to the hook without it There will be found frequent
references to the grammars where there ie no difficulty iu translating
end understanding the author, and thet for the mere purpose of in-
forming or reminding the learner of some law of the lenguuge. To
some these references will undoubtedly seem too numerous. 'l'hey
will seem to leave to the careful student too little opportunity to ex·
ercisc his own ingenuity, to leave him no difficulties to solve himself.
There is much force in this objection, end iu tha preparation of some
works for the use of learners it ought to prevail. ‚ But yet, considering
the attainments of the great body of studente who would be likely to
read this book; would not more on the whole be guiued by u multipli-
ostion of references then by their omission‘t Besides, numerous as
they ure, they do not comprise all that are inserted by Zumpt himself
in his edition,not a few having been omitted, us nunecessarily directing
the attention of the leamer to principles, with which, it might be taken
for granted, that he wus already sufficiently familiar, On this point,
therefore, the error, if there is one, is probably on the sideof scautiness.
