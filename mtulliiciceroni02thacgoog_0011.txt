PREFACE.

Tm text of this minen is that of Zumpt, us it is found in hie small·
er edition* varied in a very few instauoee on the authority of Beier,
Orelli, and Bonnell, and of Zumpt himself. The deviatione from
Zumpt’s text are generally, if not in every case, accountad for in the
notes.

The notes are derived chiefly from the editione of Zumpt and Bon-
nell,† which contain, besides their own, the veluable remmlrs and expla-
nations of the Heusingers and of Degen. Beier and Gemhard have
also been frequently consulted, and especially the notes and traatises
of Garve, who discusses so thoronghly, and in so lucid a manner, the
ideas contained in this work of Cicero. There ie un occasional refer·
ence also to the edition of Stuereubnrg, to the German interpretation
and notes oi Dr. A. W. Zumpt, and to the review of Bounell in the
Neue Jahrbi'rcher, numbers 2 and 3, of the etth volume. 'l'he render
has been referred to Freund’e Latin lexicon, without any citation of
the information required, because itis understood that en American
edition of that excellent work, prepared under the superintendenee ofa
mature and reliahle scholar, is soon to he praeuted to the publio

'l'he present edition does not profess to contain all the notes of the
commentatore named above, who have iabored on this work, nor indeed ’
the great body of them. As a general thing, all biographieal end his·
torictd notes have been omitted. It was thought that learnere in this
country were so well supplied with books of reference, containing at
considerable length the informatiou necessary for the elucidationes
the text, that it was better to allow them to consult their manuale
themselves, than to furnish them with explanatione necessarily more
